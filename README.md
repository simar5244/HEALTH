This project is divided into two segments: Mental Health and Physical Health.
For the first part, our Twitter/Facebook model searches some key words indicating low self esteem and poor mental health across social platforms 
and sends them a link to a private conversation with an AI chat-bot and/or a volunteer which may then suggest appropriate measures. 
For our second part, we use two different models covering different aspects. 
The first physical model receives input in the form of an X ray scan image which it analyses against real time data streams of thousands of scans to predict severity of Covid-19 
and the degree of infection in the patient's lungs. 
Our second physical health model uses a linear regression algorithm and real time data training to predict the probability of you contracting a
given disease like Cancer, Diabetes, and Heart ailments and the likeliness of a death event.

Data sources included in Github project.

We would further work on our projects and integrate our models in a website.
